# Biological Complexity Group @ UC Merced

**What is it?**
A cohort of faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and students interested in complex, adaptive, biological systems spanning both SNS and Shaw. This is meant to be low-time-committment interest group with occasional activities that promote interdisciplinarity by way of a common interest in biological complexity.


**Why?**
Providing a means of communication between faculty and students who are generally interested in complex biological systems may allow us to

*       Advertise or coteach courses that might be of general interest to students in different schools/programs -- perhaps increasingly important as coconvened graduate courses are discouraged and obtaining the threshold attendance among graduate students may be more of an issue
*       Increase awareness and connections between folks with intersecting interests across otherwise separated programs
*       Provide a future platform for a sanctioned 'Center' or 'Institute' down the road
*       Foster collaborations among faculty/students

**What would we do?**
Shorter term possibilities

*       Group listserve & wiki to inform members of seminars, visiting researches, events, etc that may be of interest
*       Once-per-semester working group ‘meeting’ or seminar series… similar to, but smaller than, the Species Interaction Workshop that is run by UC-Santa Cruz and Stanford

Longer term possibilities

*       Become a recognized 'institute' within UC Merced, opening funding potential
*       Fund a postdoctoral position(s) or graduate GSRs
*
