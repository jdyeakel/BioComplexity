# Biological Complexity Group @ UC Merced

**What is it?**
A cohort of faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and students interested in complex, adaptive, biological systems spanning both SNS and Shaw. This is meant to be low-time-committment interest group with occasional activities that promote interdisciplinarity by way of a common interest in biological complexity.


**Why?**
Providing a means of communication between faculty and students who are generally interested in complex biological systems may allow us to

* Advertise or coteach courses that might be of general interest to students in different schools/programs -- perhaps increasingly important as coconvened graduate courses are discouraged and obtaining the threshold attendance among graduate students may be more of an issue   
* Increase awareness and connections between folks with intersecting interests across otherwise separated programs   
* Foster collaborations among faculty/postdocs/students   
* Possibly provide a future platform for a sanctioned 'Center' or 'Institute' down the road     

**What would we do?**  
Shorter-term possibilities

* Group listserve & wiki to inform members of seminars, visiting researches, events, etc that may be of interest  
* Once-per-semester working group ‘meeting’ or workshop for people to share their work - be it well-formulated or still in the idea stage.     

Longer-term possibilities

* Become a recognized 'institute' within UC Merced, opening funding potential   
* Fund a postdoctoral position(s) or graduate GSRs
